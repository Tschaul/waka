In the following, it is implicitely assumed that all absolute times [tex]t[\/tex] and lag times [tex]\\\\Delta t[\/tex] are in units of this sampling interval. \n\nThe absolut positions [tex]\\\\vec{R}_t[\/tex] are usually of no importance by themselves. All relevant information about the walk is contained in the N steps [tex]\\\\vec{S}_t=\\\\vec{R}_t-\\\\vec{R}_{t-1}[\/tex], or the corresponding velocities [tex]\\\\vec{v}_t=\\\\vec{S}_t\/\\\\delta t_{rec}[\/tex]. These steps can be described in cartesian or polar coordinate systems, \n\n[tex]\\\\vec{S}_t = (\\\\Delta x_t , \\\\Delta y_t) = (L_t\\\\cos{\\\\varphi_t},L_t\\\\sin{\\\\varphi_t}) = L_t  \\\\vec{e}_t[\/tex], \n\nwhere [tex]\\\\vec{e}_t[\/tex] is a unit direction vector. The angle between two successive step vectors is defined as the turning angle [tex]\\\\phi_t = \\\\varphi_t-\\\\varphi_{t-1}[\/tex].\n\n[image_4]\n\nNote that it is often most natural to describe each step of a 2D random walk by its length [tex]L_{t} [\/tex] and turning angle [tex] \\\\phi_{t}[\/tex], because the agent performing the walk has usually no information about absolute positions and directions in the laboratory frame.  \n\nFor the statistical analysis of a trajectory one also compares pairs of points, or steps, that are temporally separated by a lagtime [tex]\\\\Delta t [\/tex] larger than one. For this purpose, let us define the vectorial displacement between time points m and n:\n\n[tex]\\\\Delta \\\\vec{R}_{m,n} =  \\\\vec{R}_n - \\\\vec{R}_m = (\\\\Delta x_{m,n},\\\\Delta y_{m,n}).[\/tex]\n\nIn a similar way we define the turning angle between the two time points:\n\n[tex]\\\\phi_{m,n} = \\\\varphi_n - \\\\varphi_m.[\/tex]\n\nIn order to obtain aggregated statistical properties of a trajectory, temporal averaging is often used. In the following we denote the average of a quantity f_t over all absolute time points as\n\n[tex]\\\\left\\\\langle f_t \\\\right\\\\rangle_t = \\\\frac{1}{t_{max}\\\\!-t_{min}\\\\!+\\\\!1}\\\\sum_{t\\\\!=\\\\!t_{min}}^{t_{max}} f_t.[\/tex]\n\nUsing these abbreviations we now introduce various aggregated statistical measures that can be used to analyze and classify random walks.\n\n \n[b]Distribution of displacements[\/b] \n\nThe displacement distribution is simply a normalized histogram of the distances the walker has travelled within a given lagtime [tex]\\\\Delta t[\/tex]:\n\n[tex]p(\\\\Delta R,\\\\Delta t) = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\delta(\\\\Delta R - |\\\\Delta\\\\vec{R}_{t,t+\\\\Delta t}|) \\\\right\\\\rangle_t.[\/tex]\n\n[b]Distribution of projected displacements[\/b] \n\nAn analogous distribution can be defined for the change of the walker\\'s x-coordinate within a given lagtime:\n\n[tex]p(\\\\Delta x,\\\\Delta t) = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\delta(\\\\Delta x - \\\\Delta x_{t,t+\\\\Delta t}) \\\\right\\\\rangle_t.[\/tex]\n\n[b]Distribution of turning angles[\/b] \n\nIn the same way one obtains a lagtime-dependent distribution of turning angles:\n\n[tex]p(\\\\phi,\\\\Delta t) = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\delta(\\\\phi - \\\\phi_{t,t+\\\\Delta t}) \\\\right\\\\rangle_t.[\/tex]\n\n[b]Mean squared displacement[\/b] \n\nThe mean squared displacement (MSD) \n\n[tex]\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Delta R^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\left\\\\langle |\\\\Delta\\\\vec{R}_{t,t+\\\\Delta t}|^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t [\/tex]\n\nis the second moment of the displacement distribution:\n\n[tex]\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Delta R^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} p(\\\\Delta R,\\\\Delta t) \\\\Delta R^2 d\\\\Delta R. [\/tex]\n\n[b]Mean index of directionality[\/b] \n\nA (local part of a) random walk is called directional, when many successive steps are heading into about the same direction. In this case, the turning angles are close to zero. If successive steps are in opposite directions, the (part of the) walk is called anti-directional and the turning angles are close to [tex]\\\\pi[\/tex]. In order to quantify the average directionality of a walk, it is useful to compute the cosine of the turning angle and to average it over successive steps. The resulting quantity is called the mean index of directionality:\n\n[tex]\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\cos(\\\\phi) \\\\right\\\\rangle(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\cos(\\\\phi_{t,t+\\\\Delta t})\\\\right\\\\rangle_t. [\/tex]\n\nIt has a value close to +1 for directional walks, 0 for non-directional walks and -1 for anti-directional walks. Of course, it can also be expressed by the turning angle distribution:\n\n[tex]\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\cos{\\\\phi} \\\\right\\\\rangle(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{+\\\\pi} p(\\\\phi,\\\\Delta t) \\\\cos{\\\\phi} d\\\\phi. [\/tex]\n\n[b]Velocity autocorrelation[\/b] \n\nWe define the autocorrelation function of momentary vectorial velocities in terms of the shift vectors, rather than the actual velocities, since the sampling time is cancelling out:\n\n[tex]C_{vv}(\\\\Delta t) = C_{SS}(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle (\\\\vec{S}_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{S}\\\\!>) (\\\\vec{S}_{t+\\\\Delta t} \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{S}\\\\!>)\\\\right\\\\rangle_t}{\\\\left\\\\langle (\\\\vec{S}_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{S}\\\\!>)^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t}.[\/tex]\n\nHere, [tex]<\\\\!\\\\vec{S}\\\\!> = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\vec{S}_t \\\\right\\\\rangle_t[\/tex] is the average vectorial shift per sampling time interval. The related quantity [tex]V_{drift}=<\\\\!\\\\vec{S}\\\\!>\/\\\\delta t_{rec}[\/tex] can be interpreted as a global drift velocity of the walker.\n\n[b]Correlations of step lenghts and directions[\/b]\n\nFormally, the length [tex]L_t[\/tex] and the unit direction vector [tex]\\\\vec{e}_t [\/tex] of each step [tex]\\\\vec{S}_t[\/tex] can be considered as separate time series. It is therefore useful to analyze individually the temporal correlations of lengths and directions, as well as the cross-correlations between the two.\n\nThe step-length autocorrelation function is defined as\n\n[tex]C_{LL}(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle (L_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!L\\\\!>) (L_{t+\\\\Delta t} \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!L\\\\!>)\\\\right\\\\rangle_t}{\\\\left\\\\langle (L_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!L\\\\!>)^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t}.[\/tex]\n\nThe directional autocorrelation function can be defined as\n\n[tex]C_{ee}(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle (\\\\vec{e}_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{e}\\\\!>) (\\\\vec{e}_{t+\\\\Delta t} \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{e}\\\\!>)\\\\right\\\\rangle_t}{\\\\left\\\\langle (\\\\vec{e}_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\vec{e}\\\\!>)^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t}.[\/tex]\n\nWe further define the cross-correlation function between lengths and turning angles:\n\n[tex]C_{L\\\\phi}(\\\\Delta t) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\langle (L_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!L\\\\!>) (\\\\phi_{t+\\\\Delta t} \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\phi\\\\!>)\\\\right\\\\rangle_t}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left\\\\langle (L_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!L\\\\!>)^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t} \\\\sqrt{\\\\left\\\\langle (\\\\phi_t \\\\;-\\\\; <\\\\!\\\\phi\\\\!>)^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle_t}}.[\/tex]\n\n","title":"[1] Random Walks in 2D: Statistical Measures","dateCreated":"2011-08-05 08:52:44","dateContentTouched":"2011-08-05 15:42:05","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-05 13:03:52","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-05 08:52:44","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-08-05 11:23:18","files":[],"images":[{"url":"data\/NvOYg9YsgU\/images\/4\/trajDefs.gif","dateCreated":"2011-08-05 13:03:52","id":4,"name":"trajDefs.gif"}],"comments":[],"maxCommentId":2,"users":{"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":1,"dateRead":"2012-06-18 13:41:49","dateTouched":"2011-08-18 07:58:28"}},"dateUsersTouched":"2011-08-18 07:58:28"}],"users":{"k5cyByWxrH":{"email":"claus.metzner@gmx.net","type":"editor","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-08-05 08:44:26"}},"drafts":{"k5cyByWxrH":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-08-05 08:52:44","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-05 08:44:26","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-05 08:44:26"}},"version":4}
