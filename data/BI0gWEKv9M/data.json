One of their functions is to connect the force-generating cytoskeleton of the cell, across the plasma membrane, to the extracellular matrix. In complex organisms, such cell-matrix connections have to endure extreme and rapidly changing strains as they occur during macroscopic body motions. On the other hand, the adhesions have to be dynamically dissolved and re-assembled during cell migration. Due to these variable requirements, it is reasonable to expect that the effective binding strength of a focal adhesion depends in a complex way on the temporal profile of the imposed loading. A functional description of this load-dependent binding strength would be of great value for a better understanding of the mechanical properties of cellular aggregates and also of the mechanism of cell migration.\n\nThe mechanical stability of a single- or a multi-molecular bond can be determined by rupture experiments, in which one end of the bond is fixed and the other end is pulled with an increasing force $F(t)$, typically chosen as a linearly growing force ramp $F(t)=r_lt$. This leads to an elongation of the bond and eventually to its rupture at a certain time $t=T_r$ or force $F_r=F(t_r)$. Since bond rupture is a stochastic process, a repetition of such pulling experiments leads to a distribution of rupture forces $p(F_r)$. Nevertheless, the average rupture force F_r is a reproducable measure of the bond\\'s stability. \n\nThe simplest model for a bond is a one-dimensional free energy landscape $E(x)$, where $x$ stands for the length of the bond. The lowest minimum in the energy landscape $E_0=0$ at $x_0$ defines the equilibrium length of the bond, around which its actual length is fluctuating in an environment of finite temperature $T>0$. An energy barrier of height $E_b$ at $x=x_b>x_0$ is protecting the bond from spontaneous thermal dissociation. However, an applied external pulling force $F$ lowers the effective barrier height from $E_b$ to $E_b - x_b F$, which in turn increases the rupture rate by a factor $\\\\exp{x_b F \/ k_B T}$. This simple case corrsponds to the Bell model (Ref.) and serves as a reference for more complex models.\n\nDuring a pulling experiment with linear force ramps, the momentary rupture rate of a Bell-type bond is increasing exponentially, making the rupture process to an inhomogeneous Poisson process. This leads to the well-known phenomenon that the average rupture force F_r increases logarithmically with the loading rate $r_l$ of the force ramp, i.e. the bond is effectively more stable under fast loading. \n\nAny deviation from F_r $\\\\propto \\\\log{r_l}$ can be used as experimental evidence for a bond that is more complex than the Bell model. Indeed, it has been found that some biological molecules, such as X (Ref), show an even more remarkable \\\"catch-bond\\\" behaviour: With increasing force, the effective energy barrier is lowered at first, but beyond a critical force $F_c$ starts to grow again. As a result, the bond can be effectively more stable at super-critical forces $F>F_c$ than at smaller forces $F<F_c$. In general, this non-monotonic force-dependence of the effective rupture rate can be shown to lead to characteristic deviations from F_r $ \\\\propto \\\\log{r_l}$.  \n\nWe have suspected that cellular focal adhesions, seen as a single bond, should also be more complex than the simple Bell model and might show catch-bond or other non-trivial behaviour. In order to investigate the rupture behaviour of focal adhesions in living cells, we have performed magnetic tweezer experiments (see section Materials and Methods). Using this method, linear force ramps and other loading profiles can be applied to individual focal adhesions. Since these complexes consist of many molecules that partially act in parallel, the stability of the complex is much higher than that of an individual protein. Nevertheless, the magnetic tweezer is suitable for this regime of high rupture forces.\n\nOur initial rupture experiments with X-type cells, using standard linear force ramps of variable slope $r_l$, showed no conclusive evidence for deviations from the Bell model (see section Results). Surprisingly, however, we observed a significant increase of the effective bond stability when the smooth force ramps were replaced by stair-case-shaped profiles with the same average loading rate $r_l$. This behaviour was consistently observed, even in cases where the stair-case forces where at any time larger or equal than the ramp forces, so that the rupture rates of a Bell bond would be larger (and so the stability lower) with the steppy force profiles. After confirming theoretically that the Bell model cannot explain this behaviour, we concluded that cellular focal adhesions must be described by a more complex effective energy landscape.\n\nAs the next model candidate we investigated a very simple catch bond model, in which the rupture rate displays a sudden downward jump at a critical force $F_c$ (see section X). Simulations showed that this simple model can indeed explain qualitatively the higher effective bond stability in the experiments with steppy ramps (see ...). However, it was not possible to model the measured relation between the loading rate $r_l$ and the stability F_r. As we shall demonstrate below, this deviation is probably caused by the much higher complexity of the focal adhesion complex as compared to a single molecule: First, the number and interconnection of molecules in the adhesion is highly variable from one complex to another and from cell to cell. Second, rupture in focal adhesions is a collective process that involves the subsequent yielding of different molecules. Third, the internal structure of the complex (and cytoskeleton) and the geometry of the bead lead to \\\"slack\\\" effects, so that not all molecules of the complex experience the externally applied force immediately, but with delay. After extending our single catch-bond model to a collective model with statistically fluctuating parameters, we were able to fit the measured relation between the loading rate $r_l$ and the stability F_r rather closely....","title":"Introduction (alternative version)","dateCreated":"2011-08-27 11:56:06","dateContentTouched":"2011-09-01 14:49:16","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:06","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:06","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-08-27 12:13:30","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[],"comments":[{"id":2,"user":"claus.metzner@gmx.net","content":"Outline:\n\n* Cells need flexible adhesions\n* Probably binding strength depends on loading profile\n* Maybe Catch-Bonds ?\n* To test that: Standard ramps --> but no evidence of catch-bonds\n* However: Surprising differences in the measured rupture statistics with stair-case profiles\n* Bell-bond cannot explain that\n* Single simplified catch-bond can explain Pcum\n* Plausible, since vinculin can unfold and open additional binding sites\n* However, F50-versus-loadingrate not compatible with simple model\n* Therfore more complex model --> good agreement","dateCreated":"2011-08-27 12:13:10"}],"maxCommentId":2},{"users":{"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":1,"dateTouched":"2011-08-27 12:04:46","dateRead":"2011-09-02 10:36:28"},"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-09-04 11:45:42"},"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-10-21 12:44:56"}},"id":7,"content":"Cells are anchored to their environment at focal adhesion contacts, force-transmitting molecular\naggregates that connect the cytoskeleton, via the proteins of the focal adhesion complex and transmembrane receptors, to the extracellular matrix. To measure the collective strength of focal contacts, we bind RGB-coated microbeads to the adhesion receptors of living cells and apply forces [tex]F(t)[\/tex] of up to 80 nN, using a magnetic tweezer. While the mechanical load is applied, the focal contacts are spatially displaced and eventually undergo a stochastic rupture process. The typical force [tex]F_c[\/tex] at which half of the focal contacts rupture depends on the details of the temporal loading profile [tex]F(t)[\/tex]. In the case of ramp-like loading profi\fles, [tex]F(t) = r_lt[\/tex], the typical rupture force [tex]F_c[\/tex] increases logarithmically with the loading rate [tex]r_l[\/tex], as expected for thermally activated Bell-type molecular bonds. Surprisingly, however, [tex]F_c[\/tex] further increases when the ramp is replaced by a staircase-like loading profi\fle of the same average loading rate [tex]r_l[\/tex], even if the staircase forces are at any time larger than the ramp forces. Such behavior cannot be explained by Bell-type bonds, neither by active mechano-transduction processes, but is consistent with the existence of force-strengthening catch-bonds. Our data can be replicated by a Monte Carlo simulation of the collective rupture process, assuming a system of parallel molecular bonds with uniform catch-bond behaviour, combined with a non-uniform distribution of slacks.","title":"Abstract","dateCreated":"2011-08-27 11:56:19","dateContentTouched":"2011-08-27 12:04:46","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:19","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:19","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:19","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[],"comments":[]},{"users":{"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":1,"dateTouched":"2011-08-27 11:59:00","dateRead":"2011-09-02 10:36:24"},"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-09-04 11:45:44"},"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-10-21 12:44:51"}},"id":8,"content":"Navid Bonakdar*, Achim Schilling*, Claus Metzner*, Philip Kollmannsberger+ and Ben Fabry*\n\n* Biophysics Group, University of Erlangen, Henkestr.91, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany\n\n+ Max-Planck ...","title":"Authors and Affiliations","dateCreated":"2011-08-27 11:56:40","dateContentTouched":"2011-08-27 11:59:00","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:40","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:40","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:40","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[],"comments":[]},{"users":{"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":1,"dateTouched":"2011-08-27 12:03:43","dateRead":"2011-09-02 10:36:20"},"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-09-04 11:45:45"},"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-09-01 13:56:32"}},"id":9,"content":"[b]Catch-bond behaviour of focal adhesions in living cells[\/b]","title":"Titel","dateCreated":"2011-08-27 11:56:48","dateContentTouched":"2011-08-27 12:03:43","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:48","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:48","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-08-27 11:56:48","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[],"comments":[]},{"users":{"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":1,"dateTouched":"2011-08-31 15:24:10","dateRead":"2011-10-06 16:07:28"},"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-10-11 21:50:57"},"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-10-05 12:59:36"}},"id":12,"content":"[url]http:\/\/dl.dropbox.com\/u\/24274287\/rupture.pdf[\/url]\n","title":"Paper Link","dateCreated":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","dateContentTouched":"2011-08-31 15:24:10","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-10-05 11:56:37","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[],"comments":[{"id":1,"user":"claus.metzner@gmx.net","content":"Veraltet ?","dateCreated":"2011-09-02 10:36:07"},{"id":2,"user":"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de","content":"tats\u00e4chlich - das ist noch die alte version. hab grad versucht achim zu erreichen, aber sein handy ist leider aus.

Catchbonds erkennt man daran, da\u00df die Steigung vor\u00fcbergehend kleiner wird (wie unten im Intervall [tex] \\\\left[ t_{n-1},t_n \\\\right] [\/tex]):\n\n[image_3]\n\nAuf diese Weise k\u00f6nnte man vielleicht R(F) aus den bisherigen Daten einfach durch neue Auswertung gewinnen, ohne nochmals messen zu m\u00fcssen.","title":"[14] Rekonstruktion der kraftabh\u00e4ngigen Rei\u00dfrate","dateCreated":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","dateContentTouched":"2011-10-19 16:45:22","dateImagesTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:55","dateFilesTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","dateCommentsTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","dateUsersTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","files":[],"images":[{"url":"data\/BI0gWEKv9M\/images\/3\/recRF.gif","dateCreated":"2011-10-19 13:28:55","id":3,"name":"recRF.gif"}],"comments":[]}],"users":{"96qOxYgq6F":{"email":"claus.metzner@gmx.net","type":"editor","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-08-27 11:49:29","lastNotification":"2011-10-24 13:55:29"},"4wTZ6EKkS0":{"email":"navid.bonakdar@biomed.uni-erlangen.de","type":"editor","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-08-27 12:14:20","lastNotification":"2011-10-24 13:55:29"},"EdWrwdj5OS":{"email":"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de","type":"editor","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-08-27 12:14:31","lastNotification":"2011-10-24 13:55:29"},"fyHkGYFSft":{"email":"bfabry@biomed.uni-erlangen.de","type":"subscriber","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-10-20 07:15:48","lastNotification":"2011-10-24 13:55:29"},"qcKJU8Tdk9":{"email":"richard_gerum@web.de","type":"editor","notificationCooldown":"3600","dateJoined":"2011-12-05 09:11:57"}},"drafts":{"96qOxYgq6F":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","dateImagesTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","dateFilesTouched":"2011-10-19 13:28:29","users":{"claus.metzner@gmx.net":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-10-19 13:28:29"}}},"4wTZ6EKkS0":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-08-27 12:14:20","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-27 12:14:20","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-27 12:14:20"},"EdWrwdj5OS":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","dateImagesTouched":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","dateFilesTouched":"2011-08-31 15:23:31","users":{"achim.schilling@physik.stud.uni-erlangen.de":{"mayEdit":0,"dateTouched":"1985-09-02 14:00:00","dateRead":"2011-08-31 15:23:31"}}},"fyHkGYFSft":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-10-20 07:15:48","dateImagesTouched":"2011-10-20 07:15:48","dateFilesTouched":"2011-10-20 07:15:48"},"qcKJU8Tdk9":{"title":"","content":"","files":[],"images":[],"dateContentTouched":"2011-12-05 09:11:57","dateImagesTouched":"2011-12-05 09:11:57","dateFilesTouched":"2011-12-05 09:11:57"}},"version":4}
